# 6. Shield

The `Shield` class is used to create defensive shields. Instances of the `Shield` class is used in correlation with the `Player.equipshield`. When equipping the shield, the vars `Player.shield` and `Player.shield_protect` get populated with information based on the parameters when creating an instance of `Shield` . When the shield is equipped, the player takes reduced damage from attacks.

When creating an instance, two parameters are required:

* `name`
  * The name of the shield
*  `defense`
  * The amount of damage removed when being attacked.

#### An instance can be created like this:

```python
super_shield = TARBSengine.Shield("Super Shield", 7)
# A shield with the name "Super Shield" that reduces the enemies attack by 7 damage
```
