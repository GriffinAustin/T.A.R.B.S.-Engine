# 7. Debugging

## Debugging

### 7.1 Summary

T.A.R.B.S. engine comes with some useful debugging tools. Enabling the debugger helps to see whats going on under the hood. Debugging enables you to find out, specifically, what is causing an issue in your code. **Debugging is enabled by updating the value of a var.**

```python
TARBSengine.debug = True
# Enables debugging mode
```

When `TARBSengine.debug` is set to true, it enables the `TARBSengine.debugout` function to execute. `debugout` prints what happened when a function executed. For example, if you call `Player.editinv` with debugging enabled, it will output `Debugger: item given {item} x {amount}`. The debugger told us what's going on. This allows us to figure out what is causing the issue. If you multiple functions, and something is working improperly, debugging mode can let you know, specifically, which function is causing a problem.

### 7.2 Examples

```python
player.removeitem(super_shield)
# Debugger: removed super_shield from player

player.usepotion(hp_potion)
# 5 health restored, current health: 17

player.say("This is some text")
#Steve: This is some text
```
