# 2. Enemy

## 2. The Enemy Class

### 2.1 Enemy Initialization

The `Enemy` class functions as hostile opponents for the player to battle and interact with. Enemies can be used as regular hostiles or as bosses \(special abilities not available yet\). Enemies can be used to deliver loot/key items or just to level up the player. Setting up an enemy goes as follows: 

You must supply 4 parameters when creating an instance of the enemy class:

*  `name`
  * Name of the enemy
* `hp`
  * The hp amount the enemy will spawn with
* `minatk`
  * Enemy's minimum attack damage
* `maxatk`
  * Enemy's maximum attack damage

#### Create an enemy like this:

```python
zombie = TARBSengine.Enemy("Dave the Zombie", 20, 5, 15)
```



### 2.2 Enemy.atk

#### Enemy.atk\(opponent\)

Preform a basic attack on the opponent. Attack automatically factors in the extra damage from the current weapon the player is holding. If debugging is enabled, the function outputs the total damage done and how much HP the opponent has left. This function is the same as the `Player.atk` function, just transferred over to the `Enemy` class.

#### Usage:

```python
zombie.atk(player)
## Damage done: 12
## Enemy HP: 8
```

### 

### 2.3 Enemy.say

#### Enemy.say\(text\)

Outputs text to the screen to be used as dialogue. The output contains the name of the enemy speaking as well as the text that is set in the parameters.

####  Usage:

```python
zombie.say("I'm going to eat your brains")
## Dave the Zombie: I'm going to eat your brains
```
