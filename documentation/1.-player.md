## 1. The Player Class

### 1.1 Player Initialization

For every project, there should only be one player class. The player class is the main class that the user controls. This class is the object that contains the users inventory, equipped weapons and shield, as well as attack enemies and interacts with NPCs. Setting up a player class goes as follows: 

You must supply 5 arguments when creating an instance of the player class:

*  `name`
  * Name of the player
* `hp`
  * Current HP, usually set to the same value of the `maxhp` \(for debug purposes\)
* `maxhp`
  * Maximum amount of HP \(Health Points\)
* `minatk`
  * Player's minimum attack damage
* `maxatk`
  * Player's maximum attack damage

#### Create a player like this:

```python
player = TARBSengine.Player("Steve", 20, 20, 10, 5)
```

### 

### 1.2 Player.editinv\(\)

#### Player.editinv\(item, amnt\)

Add new items to the players inventory and change amount of items that already exist in the players inventory. If debugging is enabled, \(learn how to enable debugging here\), outputs the item give and the amount.

Required arguments:

* `item`
  * The item to give the player
* `amnt`
  * The amount of items to add to the players inventory.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The item argument must be a class object.
{% endhint %}

#### Add an item to the players inventory like this:

```python
player.editinv(sword, 1)
```

#### Edit the amount of items that are already in the players inventory: 

```python
player.editinv(sword, 2)
## This will set the number of swords that the player has to 2 
## regardless of how many they currently have in their inventory.
```



### 1.3 Player.removeitem\(\)

#### Player.removeitem\(item\)

Completely removes item from the players inventory. Doesn't set the amount of the item to 0, completely deletes it from the `Player.inv` dict. As of now, needs to be used in conjunction with `Player.editinv()` once the item amount reaches 0. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Completely deleting an item from the players inventory automatically when using `Player.editinv()` is a feature that will be expected to release in Beta 1.0, possibly earlier. 

\(`removeitem()` may be re-named to `deleteitem()` in the near future\)
{% endhint %}

#### Player.removeitem\(\) usage example:

```python
player.removeitem(sword)
```
