## 1. The Player Class

### 1.1 Player Initialization

For every project, there should only be one player class. The player class is the main class that the user controls. This class is the object that contains the users inventory, equipped weapons and shield, as well as attack enemies and interacts with NPCs. Setting up a player class goes as follows: 

You must supply 5 parameters when creating an instance of the player class:

*  `name`
  * Name of the player
* `hp`
  * Current HP, usually set to the same value of the `maxhp` \(for debug purposes\)
* `maxhp`
  * Maximum amount of HP \(Health Points\)
* `minatk`
  * Player's minimum attack damage
* `maxatk`
  * Player's maximum attack damage

#### Create a player like this:

```python
player = TARBSengine.Player("Steve", 20, 20, 5, 10)
# A player with the name "Steve". Has 20 HP currently, 20 HP max,
# minimum attack damage of 5 and maximum attack damage of 10
```

### 

### 1.2 Player.editinv

#### Player.editinv\(item, amnt\)

Add new items to the players inventory and change amount of items that already exist in the players inventory. If debugging is enabled, \(learn how to enable debugging here\), outputs the item give and the amount.

Required parameters:

* `item`
  * The item to give the player
* `amnt`
  * The amount of items to add to the players inventory.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The item parameters must be a class instance.
{% endhint %}

#### Add an item to the players inventory like this:

```python
player.editinv(sword, 1)
## Debugger: item given 2 x 1
```

#### Edit the amount of items that are already in the players inventory: 

```python
player.editinv(sword, 2)
## Debugger: item given sword x 2
## This will set the number of swords that the player has to 2 
## regardless of how many they currently have in their inventory.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Changing the amount of items a player has will have its own function in Beta 1.0
{% endhint %}

### 1.3 Player.removeitem

#### Player.removeitem\(item\)

Completely removes item from the players inventory. Doesn't set the amount of the item to 0, completely deletes it from the `Player.inv` dict. As of now, needs to be used in conjunction with `Player.editinv()` once the item amount reaches 0. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Completely deleting an item from the players inventory automatically when using `Player.editinv()` is a feature that will be expected to release in Beta 1.0, possibly earlier. 

\(`removeitem()` may be re-named to `deleteitem()` in the near future\)
{% endhint %}

#### Player.removeitem\(\) usage example:

```python
player.removeitem(sword)
## Debugger: removed sword from player
```



### 1.4 Player.atk

#### Player.atk\(opponent\)

Preform a basic attack on the opponent. Attack automatically factors in the extra damage from the current weapon the player is holding. If debugging is enabled, the function outputs the total damage done and how much HP the opponent has left. Function will also automatically delete the instance of opponent if the opponent HP reaches 0. \(This feature is subject to change and mostly for debugging purposes at the moment.\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The opponent argument must be a class instance
{% endhint %}

#### Usage example:

```python
player.atk(zombie)
## Damage done: 7
## Enemy HP: 13
```



### 1.5 Player.equipweapon

#### Player.equipweapon\(weapon\)

Adds the weapon to the `Player.weapon_one`  var. The name of the weapon can also be referenced by referring to `Weapon.name`  for dialogue when equipping the weapon. When equipping the weapon, the `Weapon.atk` var is also stored in the `Player.weapon_one_atk` for adding the amount of extra damage that the weapon provides when calling `Player.atk()`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The weapon argument must be a class instance.
{% endhint %}

#### Usage:

```python
player.equipweapon(sword)
## No output
```



### 1.6 Player.equipshield

#### Player.equipshield\(shield\)

`Player.equipshield` essentially does the opposite that `Player.equipweapon` does. The shield reduces the amount of damage taken from an opposing attack by a set value. This value is stored in the `Player.shield_protect`. The shield's name is stored in `Player. shield` for reference in dialogue such as when equipping the shield or having an NPC or the player speak about it.

#### Usage:

```python
player.equipshield(super_shield)
## No output
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Debug output for `Player.equipweapon` and `Player. equipshield`is expected to be added in Alpha version 0.2.0. You can check the status of this feature [here](https://github.com/tman540/T.A.R.B.S.-Engine/issues/6).
{% endhint %}



### 1.7 Player.usepotion

#### Player.usepotion\(potion\):

This function takes potion class instances as perimeters. It consumes the potion, restores the hp to the player \(set by the `Potion.hp` var\) and removes the 1 potion of that type from the players inventory. Checking if the player's hp is already at max happens automatically. If the player is at max hp, the potion is not consumed and the function ends.

#### Usage:

```python
player.usepotion(hp_potion)
## 5 health restored, current health: 12

# Or if HP is already at max

player.usepotion(hp_potion)
## HP already at max!
```



### 1.8 Player.say

#### Player.say\(text\)

`Player.say` is used for dialogue. It outputs the text along with the player's name.

{% hint style="info" %}
Dialogue functions that are specifically for displaying the players though are planned for Alpha 0.2.0 You can check the status of this feature [here](https://github.com/tman540/T.A.R.B.S.-Engine/issues/7).
{% endhint %}

#### Usage:

```python
player.say("I think this engine is neat!")
## Steve: I think this engine is neat!
```



### 1.9 Player.openchest

#### Player.openchest\(loot\)

Delivers randomly chosen loot from a set list of possible options. Adds the chosen loot to the player's inventory. The chance of gaining one item over the other are completely random. One item doesn't have a greater chance to drop over another item. \(This functionality may be added in a later version, currently no plans\) Debug output returns the item that was chosen.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The loot argument must be a list.
{% endhint %}

#### Usage:

```python
loot = [sword, hp_potion, super_shield]
player.openchest(loot)
## Reward from chest: <TARBSengine.Weapon object at 0x7fb8639dbef0>
```

You can check the status of this bug [here](https://github.com/tman540/T.A.R.B.S.-Engine/issues/8).



### 1.10 Player. kill

#### Player.kill\(deathmessage, \*endgame\)

It kills the player and displayed a death message. The optional `endgame` argument decided if the game should exit it set to `True`.

#### Usage:

```python
player.kill("Steve fell off a cliff", True)
## Steve fell off a cliff 
## *Game Exits*
```
