# 4. Classes

#### This chapter of the documentation will cover the things that the classes have in common.

### 4.1 Item Classes

At this current period in time, the item classes are: `Weapon`, `Potion`, and `Shield`.

In version Alpha 0.2.0, the way the inventory functioned was changed entirely. \(You can view the entire changelog here\). The amount of a specific item the player has is stored within the class instance itself instead of within the player class. This allows for easier management of each item and its quantity. Example:

```python
print(sword.amnt)
# 1
print(shield.amnt)
# 2
player.additem(shield, 4)
# Debugger: item given: Super Shield x 4
print(shield.amnt)
# 4
```
