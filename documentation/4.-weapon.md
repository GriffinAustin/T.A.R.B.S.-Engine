Instances of the `Weapon` class can be equipped. The equipped weapons deal extra damage when preforming attacks with the `Player.atk` function.

You need to enter two parameters to create a weapon:

* `name`
  * The name of the weapon
* `atk`
  * The extra amount of damage that the weapon deals

#### Usage:

```python
sword = TARBSengine.Weapon("Sharp Sword", 5)
```
