# 5. Potion

The `Potion` class is used to create consumables. As of now, \(Alpha 0.1.0\), the only potions that are available to crate are HP potions. These potions restore a set amount of HP per use. The instances are used in conjunction with the `Player.usepotion`to consume the potion and restore HP. The `Player.usepotion` function handles removing the potion from the players inventory. After a potion is consumed, it cannot be used again, however, modifications to the engine \(Chapter 8\) can allow consuming potions to result in different effects or return specific items on a specific case to case basis.

{% hint style="info" %}
More potions types along with results when consuming the potion will be in newer versions of the engine.
{% endhint %}

When creating an instance, two parameters are required:

* `name`
  * The name of the potion
* `hp`
  * The amount of HP the potion restores upon consumption

#### An instance can be created like this:

```python
hp_potion = TARBSengine.Potion("Healing Potion", 5)
# A potion with the name "Healing Potion" that restores 5 HP upon consumption
```
